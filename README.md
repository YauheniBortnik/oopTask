## What to do in program
if you run program in browser:

You will see form with two modes. "Query" mode sends request to "TMDB" database and provides relevant data. Program creates cached files and uploads poster images. "List" mode just opens list of films from cached files which are stored locally. Firstly, "List" mode will show all new films, but if you will activate checkbox, "List" mode will show films with a week release date. 

if you run program in CLI:

You should run script with command "php index.php". It will send request to "TMDB" database and create cached files and upload images.

Note!

Before running in "List" mode for the first time you will need to run "Query" mode in browser or with command "php index.php" in CLI.
